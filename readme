This is a website scraper I created to assist with job hunting, practice coding in python and pandas with scraped data.
I used selenium to open the dynamic webpage then passed the opened website as an object into bs4. 

From then I extracted specific information of interest as position title, company from appropriate html tags.


Pagination wise, the code now scrapes 4 pages, with 15 job entries per page, for a total of 60 entries per each run. 
These entries are saved in a python dictionary, passed through pandas dataframe, and exported as CSV. 
In the near future, I'd like to append to python dictionary without replacing existing entries and figure out how to avoid saving duplicate entries.


I'd also like to separate (extract) finer details from the currently lengthy summary column, and perhaps place them into additional columns of the data frame.
I'm also working on coding functions that extracts with salary information appropriately.

Once sufficiently compiled, cleaned and organized, I'm looking to practice data manipulation and analysis with pandas. 

Thank you for your attention.
