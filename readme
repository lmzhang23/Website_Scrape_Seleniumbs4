This is a website scraper I created to assist with job hunting and practice coding in python. I initially used bs4 only to load indeed.com, but needed to use selenium to open the dynamic webpage first.
I then passed the  open website as an object into beautifulsoup4 and then extract information from appropriate tags. 

I have separated the project into extract and transform functions, to condense the code. 
Currently, the code can deal with 4 pages of pagination, with 15 job entries per page. 
I have saved the scraped data into python dictionary, then used pandas dataframe to export scraped data into CSV.

In the near future, I'd like to append to python dictionary without replacing existing entries, avoid duplicate entries, and automate running of the script on a set schedule. 


Thank you for your attention.
